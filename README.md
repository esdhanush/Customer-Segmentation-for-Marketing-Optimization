# Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains a comprehensive customer segmentation project focused on analyzing online retail sales data. Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding customer behavior, improving marketing strategies, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Key Features:**

- **RFM Analysis:** Utilize RFM metrics to categorize customers according to their recency of purchase, frequency of purchases, and monetary value.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Apply K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify distinct customer segments based on RFM attributes.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Visualize customer segments and RFM distributions to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, filter data for specific regions, and preprocess features for clustering algorithms.
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks are provided to guide you through the analysis process step-by-step.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and represents online retail transactions. It contains information such as customer ID, invoice number, product details, quantity, unit price, and purchase date. The dataset is preprocessed to focus on a specific region (e.g., United Kingdom) and time period.
